  <div class="section">
    <p>In a quiet village where the sky was always gray and the trees wore coats of dust, lived a boy named <span class="highlight">Elu</span>. He was differentâ€”not because of how he looked, but because of how he saw the world. While others saw dullness, Elu saw potential. He believed the sky could be blue again, the flowers could bloom in crimson, and the rivers could sparkle like liquid diamonds.</p>
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter One: The Gray Village</h2>
    <p>In a quiet village tucked between faded hills and whispering woods, the world had lost its color. The sky was a permanent shade of gray, the trees wore coats of dust, and the rivers flowed like melted silver. No one remembered the last time they saw a bluebird or a golden sunrise. The villagers had grown used to the dullness, their hearts as pale as the world around them.</p>
    <p>But one boy, named Elu, saw things differently. He was quiet, curious, and often wandered alone with a sketchbook made of scraps. While others saw gloom, Elu saw potential. He believed the sky could be blue again, the flowers could bloom in crimson, and the rivers could sparkle like liquid diamonds.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section magic">
    <p>One day, Elu found an old paintbrush buried beneath a willow tree. It shimmered with a strange light, and when he touched it, a splash of color burst into the air. He painted a single stroke across the skyâ€”and it turned <strong>azure blue</strong>. Birds began to sing. The villagers gasped. Color was returning.</p>
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter Two: The Brush Beneath the Willow</h2>
    <p>One misty morning, Elu wandered deeper into the woods than ever before. Beneath a weeping willow, he found something strangeâ€”a paintbrush, half-buried in moss, glowing faintly with a soft pink light. As he picked it up, the air shimmered. A single stroke across a tree trunk turned the bark pastel peach. Elu gasped. The brush was magic.</p>
    <div class="magic">
      <p>He painted a swirl in the skyâ€”and it turned baby blue. Birds began to sing. The villagers, watching from afar, gasped. Color was returning.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>But not everyone was pleased. The <span class="highlight">Shadow Keeper</span>, a creature made of fog and forgotten dreams, had ruled the gray skies for centuries. It roared in anger and tried to steal the brush. Elu stood firm. With every stroke, he painted memories: a golden sunrise, a violet mountain, a rainbow bridge. The Shadow Keeper shrank, unable to survive in a world of light.</p>
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter Three: The Shadow Keeper</h2>
    <p>But not everyone was pleased. Deep in the mountains lived the Shadow Keeper, a creature made of fog and forgotten dreams. It had ruled the gray skies for centuries, feeding on silence and sorrow. When it saw Eluâ€™s colors spreading, it roared in fury and slithered toward the village, determined to steal the brush and return the world to gloom.</p>
    <p>Elu stood firm. With every stroke, he painted memories: a golden sunrise, a violet mountain, a rainbow bridge. The Shadow Keeper shrank, unable to survive in a world of light and laughter.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section magic">
    <p>By sunset, the village was transformed. Children danced in fields of marigold. The rivers sang lullabies. And Elu, the boy who believed in color, became a legend. His brush now rests in the village square, glowing softlyâ€”waiting for the next dreamer to pick it up.</p>
  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter Four: The Festival of Color</h2>
    <p>By sunset, the village was transformed. Children danced in fields of marigold. The rivers sang lullabies. The houses were painted in pastel pinks, mint greens, and lavender blues. The villagers held a festival, wearing flower crowns and painting their faces with joy.</p>
    <p>Elu, the boy who believed in color, became a legend. His brush now rests in the village square, glowing softlyâ€”waiting for the next dreamer to pick it up.</p>
