    <h1>The Boy Who Painted the Sky</h1>
    <p>A story of color, courage, and imagination</p>
  </header>

  <div class="section">
    <p>In a quiet village where the sky was always gray and the trees wore coats of dust, lived a boy named <span class="highlight">Elu</span>. He was different—not because of how he looked, but because of how he saw the world. While others saw dullness, Elu saw potential. He believed the sky could be blue again, the flowers could bloom in crimson, and the rivers could sparkle like liquid diamonds.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section magic">
    <p>One day, Elu found an old paintbrush buried beneath a willow tree. It shimmered with a strange light, and when he touched it, a splash of color burst into the air. He painted a single stroke across the sky—and it turned <strong>azure blue</strong>. Birds began to sing. The villagers gasped. Color was returning.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>But not everyone was pleased. The <span class="highlight">Shadow Keeper</span>, a creature made of fog and forgotten dreams, had ruled the gray skies for centuries. It roared in anger and tried to steal the brush. Elu stood firm. With every stroke, he painted memories: a golden sunrise, a violet mountain, a rainbow bridge. The Shadow Keeper shrank, unable to survive in a world of light.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section magic">
    <p>By sunset, the village was transformed. Children danced in fields of marigold. The rivers sang lullabies. And Elu, the boy who believed in color, became a legend. His brush now rests in the village square, glowing softly—waiting for the next dreamer to pick it up.</p>
