    ("The Magic Brush", [
        "One day, Elu found an old paintbrush buried beneath a willow tree. It shimmered with a strange light.",
        "He painted a single stroke across the skyâ€”and it turned pastel blue. Birds began to sing. Color was returning."
    ], "blue"),

    ("Red for Memory", [
        "He painted roses that blushed in red, and the village square bloomed with warmth.",
        "The elders wept, remembering love letters written long ago. Red became the color of memory."

    ("Purple for Dreams", [
        "He painted purple mountains that shimmered with mystery. The stars above twinkled in response.",
