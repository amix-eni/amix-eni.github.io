    "Chapter One: Whispers in the Dust": [
        "In the village of Aroko, the wind had stopped telling stories.",
        "Once, it had danced through the market stalls, rustling palm leaves and whispering secrets to children who listened closely.",
        "But now, it moved like a ghost—silent, heavy, and tired. The skies hung low, the earth cracked with thirst, and the people spoke only when necessary.",
        "Sewa was seventeen, and she hated silence. She wrote in the margins of old newspapers, on banana leaves, even on the walls of her room.",
        "Her words weren’t just poems—they were protests. She believed stories could heal, that language had power, and that the wind was waiting for someone to speak again."
    ],
    "Chapter Two: The Letter Beneath the Baobab": [
        "One evening, Sewa climbed the hill behind the village, where the ancient baobab tree stood like a guardian.",
        "She sat beneath its roots and whispered a poem into the breeze: 'If the wind forgets its name, I’ll write it in the sky.'",
        "As she spoke, something shifted. A gust of wind curled around her ankles, and a folded piece of paper fluttered out from beneath the tree.",
        "It was old, soft as silk, and written in a language she didn’t recognize. But the paper pulsed—like it was alive.",
        "Her mother’s face turned pale. 'This is wind-script,' she whispered. 'It hasn’t been seen in generations.'"
    ],
    "Chapter Three: The Silence Comes": [
        "That night, the wind stopped completely. No rustling leaves. No humming insects. No breath between the stars.",
        "The village fell into a hush so deep it felt like drowning. Children forgot their names. Elders stared blankly at the sky.",
        "But Sewa remembered. She stood beneath the baobab and spoke. Her voice cracked, but the wind stirred.",
        "She told stories—of her childhood, of her dreams, of the ancestors who danced in moonlight. And with each word, color returned."
    ],
    "Chapter Four: The Journey to Elaria": [
        "Sewa knew she couldn’t stay. The silence was only a shadow of what was coming.",
        "Guided by the wind, she left Aroko with nothing but her journal, a pouch of Mama Teni’s herbs, and the wind-script letter.",
        "She crossed deserts that whispered her name, rivers that sang lullabies, and mountains that tested her courage.",
        "In Elaria, she found others—keepers of forgotten languages, dancers who moved like poetry, and painters who bled color into the sky."
    ],
    "Chapter Five: The Story That Saved the World": [
        "When the silence returned, it came as a storm—black, endless, and hungry.",
        "It swallowed voices, erased memories, and turned dreams to dust.",
        "Sewa stood at the edge of the world and wrote. She wrote of love, laughter, and a girl who believed her words could change everything.",
        "Her story became light. Her voice became wind. And the world remembered."
    ],
    "Epilogue: The Wind Still Writes": [
        "Back in Aroko, the baobab tree hums with stories. Children climb its roots and whisper dreams.",
        "The wind carries their words across oceans and into hearts.",
        "And somewhere, in a realm between breath and memory, Sewa writes still."
